"""The browser's rules: the tool's words, what a call may reach, and how Chrome and the browser
engine are started. Pure.

Decided with the user on 12/10/2026 (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, Browser):

- **One code tool**: the model writes Python against the helpers of Browser Use's browser-harness,
  which run it against the browser; the browser and a workspace last across calls.
- **Atlas's own Chrome profile**, and two throwaway modes, clean and headless.
- **No takeover**: a lease, the user taking the window over from the agent, was dropped on
  20/10/2026 with the screen that offered it (decided with the user). At a login the model stops
  and asks; the user signs in in the window and says so.
- **The cloud metadata floor**: an address that hands out a cloud machine's credentials is never
  reached, whatever the browser.

    "code: drop duplicates, count and sort in Python, never in your head, and before answering "
    "check the number collected against the number asked for.\n\n"
    "Put a whole sub-procedure (navigate, wait, extract, act) in one call rather than a call for "
